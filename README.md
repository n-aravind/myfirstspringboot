# myfirstspringboot

- In IntelliJ create a maven project from the org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart. Put in 'hello' for the group Id and put "myfirstspringboot" for the artifact id.
- Delete the App file and the AppTest classes
- You will follow the "start from scratch" instruction but do the Build with Maven (not Build with Gradle nor Build with your IDE)
- You do not need to create the src/main/java/hello directory because it already exists
- Replace the contents of the pom.xml file with the one in the tutorial. Note that whenever you touch the pom.xml IntelliJ will prompt you to reimport. Make sure you do this!
- Now you can work through the tutorial
